Cross Cribbs

Created by Benjamin D Critoph and Jeffrey D Wang

A responsive multiplayer cross cribbs app developped using TypeScript. I used React for the frontend framework, Node for the game server and Socket IO for multiplayer functionality. Users can play Cross Cribbs locally or multiplayer 1v1 or 2v2 in teams. In multiplayer users can host or join a game room to play together.
